        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large deep saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger and chilli. Cook for 2 minutes or until aromatic. Add chicken stock, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and 3 cups of water and bring to the boil.</li>
            <li>Add corn and broccolini to stock. Cook broccolini for 2 minutes and corn for 5 minutes or until tender. Remove corn and place on a chopping board. Transfer broccolini to a bowl. Add mushrooms to stock and cook for 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to bowl with broccolini. Add noodles to stock and cook for 4 minutes. Cut kernels from corn.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a frying pan over a medium high heat. Rub oil over steak and season. Cook for 3-4 minutes each side for medium-rare. Transfer to a plate and stand for 10 minutes. Thinly slice.</li>
            <li>Bring a medium saucepan of water to the boil. Reduce heat to low, and when bubbles subside, use a spoon to stir the water until a whirlpool forms. Break an egg into a small bowl and gently slide into whirlpool. Cook for 3 minutes or until white is cooked. Use a slotted spoon to transfer egg to a plate. Repeat with remaining eggs.</li>
            <li>Place noodles and stock into serving bowls. Top with broccolini, corn, mushrooms, beef and an egg. Sprinkle with onions, sesame seeds and chilli. Serve.</li>
